# Wide Receiver U
Many colleges lay claim to the title of “Wide Receiver University” such as Ohio State which as produced star receivers Justin Jefferson and Ja’marr Chase, Alabama with Julio Jones and Devonta Smith, Andre Johnson and Reggie Wayne both come from the U at Miami. Multiple colleges have produced extremely skilled wide receivers but who has done it the most consistent is what is most important.

# Data Sources and Variables
This data come from NFLReadR which gathers most of its data from Pro Football Focus. We took a look at the past 25 years of NFL draft and player stats to use in our analysis. Below is some of the formulas and Criteria
* Receiver Score: Career Receptions x 2 + Career Yards x 3 + Career Touchdowns + 1st Team All Pro Selections x10
* Minimum Receiver Attributes: Only wide receivers who were drafted, started at least one NFL season, recorded a minimum of 10 receptions, and appeared in at least 16 games are included
* Minimum Receivers Drafted: In this analysis we only included colleges that had a minimum of 3 wide receivers drafted in the past 25 years.
* Z-Score: Each Receiver Score - Total Average Receivers Score divided by the Standard Deviation of the Total Receivers Score, helps find careers above the standard. 
We also looked at the average draft position of each receiver from a college and keep track of how many first round picks each college had.

# The Colleges

Ohio State had the most amount of Wide Receivers drafted with 16, and was tied with Alabama for the most first round selections with 8. Alabama also had the highest average draft position with a average pick number of 26, nearly all their receivers were drafted in the the first round.

# The U is Wide Receiver U
After looking at all the scores for each college we took into account every other facet such as draft position, outliers and first round picks to determine who is Wide Receiver University. Only one college was consistently in the top 15 of each of these metrics, as well as top 5 for overall score, average score and outliers and that was The U. We declare Miami (FL) is the Wide Receiver University, they are one of two schools to have a wide receiver already inducted into the Hall of Fame in Andre Johnson and Reggie Wayne awaiting his turn. Miami (FL) also had receivers with some of the longest tenures with a average career of 10 years, well above the NFL standard of 3 years.
